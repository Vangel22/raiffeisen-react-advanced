Task 2: Suspense with Lazy Loading

Goal: Practice using Suspense and lazy loading for heavy components.

Instructions:

Create a heavy component (ChartComponent) that simulates being “big” by adding some fake delay (e.g., setTimeout).

Use React.lazy to load this component only when needed.

Wrap it with Suspense and display a "Loading chart..." fallback.

Add a button "Show Chart" to render it only when clicked.

Example:

const ChartComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./ChartComponent"));

<Suspense fallback={<p>Loading chart...</p>}>
  {showChart && <ChartComponent />}
</Suspense>
