Task 1: Understanding useTransition

Goal: Practice using useTransition for smoother UI updates.

Instructions:

Create a component with an input box and a list of 5,000 names (you can generate them with a loop).

Filter the list based on the input text.

Without useTransition, the input should feel laggy.

Wrap the filtering logic with startTransition or useTransition to make typing smoother.

Show a small "Updating..." message while the transition is pending.
