Task 3: Data Fetching with Suspense

Goal: Combine data fetching with Suspense for a smooth user experience.

Instructions:

Create a fetchUsers() function that fetches data from an API like https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.

Wrap this in a simple “resource” object (like in React docs) so it suspends while loading.

Create a UserList component that renders the users.

Wrap UserList with Suspense and show "Loading users..." while fetching.

Handle an error boundary for failed requests.
