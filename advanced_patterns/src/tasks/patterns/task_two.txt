Create a FAQ component where each FAQItem can be expanded or collapsed to show an answer.

FAQ is the parent wrapper.

FAQItem is a child that shows a question and toggles the answer when clicked.

The answer is passed as nested children.

Starter code:

```tsx
import { useState, type ReactNode } from "react";

interface FAQProps {
  children: ReactNode;
}

interface FAQItemProps {
  question: string;
  children: ReactNode;
}
export function FAQ({ children }: FAQProps) {
    // TODO
}

export function FAQItem({ question, children }: FAQItemProps) {
    // TODO
}

```

Usage:

```tsx
<FAQ>
  <FAQItem question="What is React?">
    React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem question="What is a Compound Component?">
    Multiple components that work together to build a single feature.
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem question="Why use them?">
    They help make code reusable, clean, and easy to understand.
  </FAQItem>
</FAQ>
```
