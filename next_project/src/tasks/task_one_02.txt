2️⃣ Nested Route

Create a file: app/library/collections/page.tsx

Display: "Library Collections Page"

Test: Visit /library/collections

3️⃣ Protected Route

Create a file: app/admin/page.tsx

Simulate auth with a boolean: isAuthenticated = false

If not authenticated, redirect to /login using redirect()

Display "Your Profile" if authenticated

Test: Visit /admin → should redirect to /login

4️⃣ Programmatic Navigation

In sign in page (app/signin/page.tsx):

Create a simple form with email/password

On submit, fake sign in and redirect to /library/collections using router.push("/library/collections")

Use "use client" and useRouter() for navigation

Optional Bonus

Wrap library pages with app/library/layout.tsx

Add header/sidebar that stays across nested pages
