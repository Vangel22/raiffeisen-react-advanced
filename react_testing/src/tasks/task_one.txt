##  Part 1 – Create a Loan Function

* Create a function:

```ts
function calculateLoan(amount, percentage) {}
```

* The function should:

  * Return the interest amount (`amount * percentage / 100`).
  * Throw an error if:

    * The input is not a number (e.g. text).
    * The input is negative.

---

## Part 2 – Unit Tests with Vitest

* Write a test suite for `calculateLoan`.
* Test at least these cases:

  1. Valid calculation (e.g. `1000` and `40` → `400`).
  2. Different percentages (e.g. `500` and `20` → `100`).
  3. Invalid input (e.g. `"abc"` → should throw an error).
  4. Negative input (e.g. `-100` → should throw an error).

---

## Part 3 – LoanCalculator Component

* Create a React component `LoanCalculator.tsx`.
* It should:

  * Have an input for **amount**.
  * Have an input for **percentage**.
  * A button **Calculate**.
  * Show the calculated interest below the button.
  * Show a validation error message if the input is invalid (text or negative numbers).

## Part 4 – Component Tests with RTL

* Write tests that cover:

  1. User enters amount and percentage → clicks calculate → result is shown.
  2. User enters text instead of number → error message is shown.
  3. User enters negative number → error message is shown.
