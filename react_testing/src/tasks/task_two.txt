## Part 1 – Create a Fetch Function

* Create a function:

```ts
async function fetchCharacters() {}
```

* This function should:

  * Fetch data from the **Rick and Morty API**:
    `https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character`
  * Return a list of characters (only `id`, `name`, and `status`).

---

## Part 2 – CharacterList Component

* Create a React component `CharacterList.tsx`.
* It should:

  * Show a **loading state** while fetching.
  * Display a list of characters after fetching.
  * Show an **error message** if the API call fails.

---

## Part 3 – Integration Tests with Vitest + RTL

Write tests for `CharacterList`:

1. Should render a **loading indicator** before data appears.
2. Should display a **list of characters** after successful fetch.
3. Should display an **error message** if the API fails.
4. Use **mocking** for the API call instead of hitting the real API during tests.
